## dbt models for `jaffle_shop`

this is my merge conflict


`jaffle_shop` is a fictional ecommerce store. This dbt project transforms raw
data from an app database into a customers and orders model ready for analytics.

The raw data from the app consists of customers, orders, and payments, with the
following entity-relationship diagram:

This [dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/) project has a split personality:
* **Tutorial**: The [tutorial](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop/tree/master)
  branch is a useful minimum viable dbt project to get new dbt users up and
  running with their first dbt project. It includes [seed](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference#seed)
  files with generated data so a user can run this project on their own warehouse.
* **Demo**: The [demo](https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop/tree/demo/master)
  branch is used to illustrate how we (Fishtown Analytics) would structure a dbt
  project. The project assumes that your raw data is already in your warehouse,
  so therefore the repo cannot be run as a standalone project. The demo is more
  complex than the tutorial as it is structured in a way that can be extended for
  larger projects.

### Using this project as a demonstration
This project should be read in conjuction with our guide on "[How we structure
our dbt projects](https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355)".

### What is a jaffle?
A jaffle is a toasted sandwich with crimped, sealed edges. Invented in Bondi in 1949, the humble jaffle is an Australian classic. The sealed edges allow jaffle-eaters to enjoy liquid fillings inside the sandwich, which reach temperatures close to the core of the earth during cooking. Often consumed at home after a night out, the most classic filling is tinned spaghetti, while my personal favourite is leftover beef stew with melted cheese.
